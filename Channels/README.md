**Channels in Go**

*Purpose:* Channels are like pipes that allow goroutines to send and receive values.

*Creation:* Use `make(chan type)` to create a channel, where `type` is the data type the channel will hold (e.g., `chan int`).

*Sending:* Use the channel operator `<-` to send a value to a channel (e.g., `c <- 5`).

*Receiving:* Use the channel operator `<-` to receive a value from a channel (e.g., `value := <-c`).

*Synchronization:* Sending and receiving on a channel are blocking operations, which helps synchronize goroutines.
